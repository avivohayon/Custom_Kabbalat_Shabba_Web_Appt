## About me
I am a dedicated developer who believes in the power of technology to bring people together and enhance our lives. In addition to my professional work, I have volunteered for social enterprises like Max Impact and Tmura. These experiences have instilled in me a deep appreciation for the importance of social responsibility and the potential for technology to create meaningful change.

## Project Highlights
During the development of this web app, I had the opportunity to work extensively with React, HTML, and CSS. Leveraging the flexibility and scalability of these technologies, I created an intuitive user interface that allows individuals to customize their own Kabbalat Shabbat experience. By providing a platform where people can honor Jewish traditions while embracing personal preferences, we aim to foster a sense of inclusivity and reconnection.
